createRoot -> create virtual DOM and only update only which is differ from Main DOM

But if there are 2 consecutive updates is it possible to wait for 2 updates and changes after final instead of doing 2 changes standalone ?

That is not immedidate update but after certain time

React Fibre is algo responsible for update 
- incremental rendering

- Reconciliation
- Diffing of list is performed using keys. Keys(stable, predicable, unique)
